=head1 NAME

Game::TextMapper::Smale - generate fantasy wilderness maps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $text = Game::TextMapper::Smale->new
        ->generate_map($width, $height, $bw);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This generates a wilderness map based on the algorithm by Erin D. Smale. See the
blog posts at L<http://www.welshpiper.com/hex-based-campaign-design-part-1/> and
L<http://www.welshpiper.com/hex-based-campaign-design-part-2/> for more
information.

Generally speaking, the idea is that the algorithm picks a random terrain for a
hex in the middle of the map. Based on that, the surrounding hexes a bit further
away are picked, and finally the remaining hexes are picked. This is why the
maps vary so drastically in terrain distribution.

=head1 METHODS

Note that this module acts as a class with the C<generate_map> method, but none
of the other subroutines defined are actual methods. They don't take a C<$self>
argument.

#  1. Treat as coastal (beach or scrub) if adjacent to water
#  2. 66% light forest
#  3. 33% rocky desert or high sand dunes
#  4. Treat as farmland in settled hexes
#  5. 33% heavy forest
#  6. 66% forested hills
#  7. 66% forested mountains
#  8. 33% forested hills
#  9. 20% canyon or fissure (not implemented)
# 10. 40% chance of a pass (not implemented)
# 11. 33% forested mountains
# 12. 20% chance of a dominating peak; 10% chance of a mountain pass (not
#     implemented); 5% volcano (not implemented)
#
# Notes
# water:    water
# sand:     sand or dust
# swamp:    dark-grey swamp (near trees) or dark-grey marshes (no trees)
# plains:   light-green grass, bush or bushes near water or forest
# forest:   green trees (light), green forest, dark-green forest (heavy);
#           use firs and fir-forest near hills or mountains
# hill:     light-grey hill, dust hill if sand dunes
# mountain: grey mountain, grey mountains (peak)

# later, grass land near a settlement might get the colors soil or dark-soil!
